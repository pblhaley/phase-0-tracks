<!--
1. HTML5 semantic tags are purely organizational NOT aesthetic and they help to organize a page to make it more user friendly for computer software common among differently-abled communities. I think that they are all pretty useful, but I like the breakdown of main-article-section because it makes my HTML feel and look more organized to my eyes.
2. The browser reads down the page, top to bottom.
3. Snippets! I learned that sublime actually already has a lot of snippets to use. Before now I had been typing in all the opening and closing tags and now I'm VERY happy to be able to just tab over and have it autofill. I think I will create more snippets at a later date, but for my scope and what I am learning right now, I think sublime already has all the snippets I would need to use.
4. The organization of the semantic elements took me a second to understand, specifically which elements needed to be wrapped in parent elements and which ones could stand on their own. I've done some researching on my own to answer most of the questions, but I think just seeing them used, and practicing using them, is really gonna drive the point home.
